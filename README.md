Project Title: Comparative Analysis of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Sabra Health Care REIT Inc. (SBRA) vs. Equity Residential (EQR)

Description:
In this project, I conducted a financial analysis of two Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Sabra Health Care REIT Inc. (NASDAQ: SBRA) and Equity Residential (NASDAQ: EQR), covering the period from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018. REITs are companies that own or operate income-producing real estate, offering a way to invest in real estate portfolios similarly to investing in stocks.

Using Python and NumPy, I analyzed and compared the performance of these two REITs, focusing on key financial statistics such as daily returns, average returns, volatility, and cumulative returns. The analysis was carried out by processing raw data to gain insights into the investment potential and risk profiles of these REITs.

Key Features:

	•	Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the REITs data for analysis using NumPy.
	•	Return Analysis: Calculated daily returns, average returns, and cumulative returns for both REITs.
	•	Volatility Assessment: Evaluated the volatility of each REIT to understand the associated risk.
	•	Conclusion: Provided insights into which REIT might be a better investment based on the analyzed data.

Technologies Used:

	•	Python
